### Fixing the Sort Method in the Hand class

This program takes the blackjack code from class and fixes the sort method to print out all cards in 
ascending order based on each card's rank.

Originally the sort method would compare one card to all cards after it; however, it would switch the card previous to the one intended due to the indexes when it found one that was greater.
