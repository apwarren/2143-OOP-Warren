## PO1 - Stack Upgrade
### Allyson Warren
### Description:

This program uses an array-based Stack data structure to insert or remove integer values
and then prints them out starting from the last value added. If the stack is empty then the
program prints an error message. If the stack is full then the program will 
create a new array double the size of the previous and reallocate the previous data into it
to have a stack of big enough size. The program then prints out all changes made to the 
stack's size to the screen and prints the initial, largest, and ending size of the stack
to an output file.
