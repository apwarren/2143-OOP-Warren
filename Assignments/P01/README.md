## PO1 - Stack Upgrade
### Allyson Warren
### Description:

This program uses an array-based Stack data structure to insert or remove integer values
and then prints them out starting from the last value added. If the stack is empty then the
program prints an error message to the screen. If the stack is full then the program will 
create a new array double the size of the previous and reallocate the previous data into it
to have a stack of big enough size.
