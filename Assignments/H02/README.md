#### Abstraction

>  A technique for deciding the complexity of computer systems by determining a level of complex for which a person interacts with the system.
 It suppresses the more complex details behind the current level.

#### Encapsulation

>
>It is also a language mechanism for restricting access to some components.

#### Friends
> A class that can access private and protected members of another class in which it is declared as friend. 

#### Inheritance
> An object that can acquire and access all the public and protected properties and methods of a "parent object."

#### Instance Variable
> A variable that is declared in a class and is accessible to all attributes and methods within the class.

#### Member Variable
> A variable that is associated with a specific object and is accessible for all its methods.

#### Method
> A function associated with a class that defines a particular behavior of a class instance. Classes can have multiple methods.

#### Multiple Inheritance
> An object or class that inherits characteristics and features from more than one parent object or class.
>

#### Object
> A specific instance of a class where the object can be a combination of variables, functions, and data structures.

#### Overloading
> Two or more functions with the same name within the same scope. 
>
> Each function has a different signature (list of parameters) that tell the computer which specific function to call.

#### Public/ Private/ Protected
> Access Modifiers for classes. Public members are accessible from anywhere outside and inside the class. 
  Private members cannot be accessed or viewed from outside the class. 
  Protected members are like private members but can be accessed by derived classes.

#### Virtual
> A nested inner class whose functions and member variables can be overridden and redefined by subclasses of its outer class.
